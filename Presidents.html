                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Robert Soza; the President for the Faculty Association. I am English Faculty at Mesa Community College. I am in my eighth year as a full-time faculty member in Maricopa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role as President is to support the Association. I am genuinely proud to be part of such a remarkable team here at the Association; seeing how thoughtfully everyone works to support faculty interests is impressive. Also, it would be rude of me to not also acknowledge the tremendous faculty who work with me at MCC. I am fortunate to be a part of two great teams.

                <p>
                    I am Mike Mitchell, the Faculty Association President-elect. Paradise Valley Community College is my home college where I teach in the English Division. I have been a full-time faculty member of the MCCCD for 25 years.               
                </p>
                <p>
                    As President-elect, my primary role is to support the work of President Robert Soza and Past-President Salina Bednarek. Secondarily, it is my role to learn the many functions of the FA President and to orient myself to the operations, projects and goals of the Faculty Association in preparation for serving as its President in 17-18. Today, we have the opportunity to provide shape and direction to the future of the MCCCD in ways previous generations of faculty could not have imagined. It is my belief that we can and will come together to do this in the coming year.
